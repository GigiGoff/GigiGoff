# Gigi Goff
**Aspiring bioinformatics analyst** | Biology background (lab + data) | Learning Python/R, NGS & BLAST workflows

### About
I’m transitioning into bioinformatics from a strong biology foundation. I like small, reproducible projects that show real skills: clean data handling, transparent methods, and clear interpretation.

### Projects
- **BLAST Protein Identification (Mini Project)**  
  Confirmed an “unknown” protein sequence as human hemoglobin beta using BLASTp; documented methods, results, and interpretation.

### Skills (growing)
- Biology: experimental design, sample handling, research integrity  
- Data: Python/R basics, Excel, SQL (beginner)
- Bioinformatics: BLAST, FASTA/FASTQ, NCBI/UniProt
